# scoryStory2.0
Scory Story is a program that automatically creates dynamic soundtracks for written works by analyzing a piece of text and implementing a multinomial Naive Bayes based algorithm to classify paragraphs into literary scenes (e.g., romance scene, fight scene, etc...).
In addition, an algorithm is used to blend paragraphs with similar genres together so that song change occurs at an appropriately decreased rate.
